# Expectations
Automated Expectations Mapping from RB Questionnaires

## Phase 1: 
Run the current tokenizing and lemmatizing code for all the long form response fields in the data and answer questions on what are the most commonly used words, how they match with the other columns, etc. 
 
I will set the end of next week as a soft deadline for this - factoring in Sankarshans comments about deadlines prohibiting deeper understanding. I will have my monthly test two weeks from now, so having completed at least one milestone before taking a small study break would be a good idea. 

Output format - notebook

## Phase 2: 
Take a deeper dive into NLP and ML, research and implement standard algorithms. The final output of this task will be a mechanism to place students into different groups/categories/clusters/buckets. Whatever model we design, explainability of results is compulsory. 

Output format - notebook & algorithm to generalise expectations


## Phase 3: 
This is the more ambitious part. Currently, the data provided to me is just the responses. In this phase, Sankarshan will also give me the solve ninja profiles of students and what they achieved, and we will attempt to map the responses (inputs) to the work they did (outputs).
